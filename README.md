# Candidate Task List

Please complete the following tasks. Each task builds on the existing codebase (SQLite3 + Express.js + pure HTML).

## Tasks

- [x] **Task 1 — Add Employee**
  Create an "Add Employee" form that allows submitting a new employee record to the database via a `POST /api/employees` endpoint.

- [x] **Task 2 — Edit Employee**
  Add an "Edit" button on each row that opens a form pre-filled with the employee's current data. Implement a `PUT /api/employees/:id` endpoint to save changes.

- [x] **Task 3 — Delete Employee**
  Add a "Delete" button on each row with a confirmation prompt. Implement a `DELETE /api/employees/:id` endpoint to remove the record.

- [x] **Task 4 — Pagination**
  Limit the employee table to 5 rows per page. Add Previous / Next controls and a page indicator. Pagination should work together with search and department filter.

- [x] **Task 5 — Department Salary Pie Chart**
  Add a `GET /api/salary-by-department` endpoint that returns the total salary grouped by department. On the frontend, render a pie chart using only pure HTML5 Canvas (no external chart libraries) that visualises each department's share of the total salary. Display the chart on the employee directory page.

## How to run the repo:
- Use `npx tsx two_sum.ts` to run the question
- Use `npm start` to run the project
- [ ] **Question from Candidate:**
Department dropdown issue: If there are no employees in the system, how should the department dropdown be populated? My understanding is that we could seed the Department table with initial data. Would that be the expected approach?
